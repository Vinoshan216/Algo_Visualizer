# Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a Python-based algorithm visualizer using Tkinter and Matplotlib. It demonstrates the working of common sorting algorithms with real-time graphical representation to help with visualizing how sorting algorithms work. 

## Features
- Sorting algorithms implemented:
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
- Real-time visualization using Matplotlib animations.
- User-friendly interface with Tkinter (future expansion potential).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter
- NumPy

## Code Overview
- **`main.py`**: Contains the sorting algorithm implementations and visualization logic.
  - `insertion_sort(arr, length)`
  - `selection_sort(arr, length)`
  - `bubble_sort(arr, length)`
- Matplotlib is used for animation and Tkinter can be extended for GUI improvements.

## Future Improvements
- Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
- Implement a Tkinter GUI for algorithm selection and speed control.
- Improve animation efficiency and visual effects.
